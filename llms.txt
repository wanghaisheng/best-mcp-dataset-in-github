# MCP GitHub Popular Repo Discovery Tool - Website Introduction
> The MCP GitHub Popular Repo Discovery Tool is a command-line utility designed to help users efficiently find, categorize, and analyze popular GitHub repositories, with a special focus on Minecraft (MCP) projects, but applicable to any keyword-based search.

## Website/Tool Background
This tool was created to address the challenge of sifting through numerous GitHub repositories to find relevant and high-quality projects. It automates the search and data collection process, providing users with structured information including repository names, descriptions, star/fork counts, extracted keywords, and preliminary categorization and tech stack identification. The vision is to simplify the discovery of valuable open-source projects for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts.

## Main URLs (Conceptual for a future web interface or documentation)
- `https://mcp.deepseek.diy`
  - The conceptual homepage for the MCP Hub, potentially hosting documentation or links to the CLI tool and its output data.
- `https://mcp.deepseek.diy/docs` (Conceptual)
  - Future location for detailed documentation on how to use the tool, configure it, and understand its output.
- `https://mcp.deepseek.diy/data/` (Conceptual)
  - A possible location where generated JSON datasets (like `data_YYYY-MM-DD.json`) could be accessed if the tool is run by a service.
- `https://mcp.deepseek.diy/privacy`
  - Details the website's privacy policy.
- `https://mcp.deepseek.diy/terms`
  - Outlines the terms of service.

## Content Categories (Tool Features)
### [Keyword-Based GitHub Search](https://mcp.deepseek.diy)
Performs searches on GitHub for repositories matching user-defined keywords (e.g., "mcp server", "saas boilerplate").

### [Data Extraction & Filtering](https://mcp.deepseek.diy)
Extracts key information (name, description, URL, stars, forks) and allows filtering by minimum stars and forks.

### [Automated Categorization](https://mcp.deepseek.diy)
Assigns categories to repositories based on keywords found in their descriptions (e.g., "server_core_bukkit_like", "proxy", "plugin_or_mod" for MCP; "ecommerce", "ai", "saas" for general SaaS).

### [Tech Stack Identification](https://mcp.deepseek.diy)
Identifies potential technologies used in the repositories based on keywords (e.g., "java", "spigot", "forge", "python", "nextjs").

### [Dated JSON Output](https://mcp.deepseek.diy)
Saves the collected and processed data into a JSON file with a date suffix (e.g., `results/data_YYYY-MM-DD.json`), allowing for historical tracking and easy integration with other tools.

## User Value
- **Saves Time:** Automates the tedious process of manually searching and evaluating GitHub repositories.
- **Improves Discovery:** Helps uncover relevant projects, especially in niche areas like MCP server development.
- **Provides Structured Data:** Outputs categorized and tech-identified repository information in a machine-readable format.
- **Facilitates Analysis:** Enables users to compare projects, track trends (by comparing dated outputs), and make informed decisions.
- **Supports Research & Development:** Aids developers in finding tools, libraries, or inspiration, and researchers in gathering data on software projects.

## Technical SEO / CLI Tool Notes
- The primary product is a Python command-line (CLI) tool.
- The website (`https://mcp.deepseek.diy`) serves as a conceptual hub, potentially for documentation, tool download, or access to pre-generated datasets.
- SEO for the website would focus on discoverability for terms like "GitHub repo discovery tool," "MCP project finder," etc.
- The tool itself uses the GitHub API and outputs JSON data locally.
